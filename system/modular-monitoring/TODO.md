- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- **Logging**: structlog with JSON output
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage, hypothesis for property testing
- **Documentation**: mkdocs with material theme

### **Backwards Compatibility**
- Keep bash version as "legacy mode" during transition
- Provide migration tools and documentation
- Maintain feature parity during migration
- Support both systems running in parallel for validation
