# Global Autofix Configuration
# These settings control the behavior of all generic autofix scripts

# Emergency Process Kill Settings (Global Defaults)
# Note: These settings are now defined in individual module configs for better modularity
# - PROCESS_CPU_THRESHOLD: moved to thermal.conf, i915.conf, memory.conf, kernel.conf
# - MEMORY_KILL_THRESHOLD: moved to memory.conf  
# - KILL_PROCESS_WAIT_TIME: moved to thermal.conf, usb.conf, i915.conf, memory.conf, kernel.conf
# These remain as fallback defaults for modules that don't specify their own values:
PROCESS_CPU_THRESHOLD=10          # Minimum CPU % to consider for emergency killing (fallback)
MEMORY_KILL_THRESHOLD=15          # Minimum memory % to consider for emergency killing (fallback)
GRACE_PERIOD_SECONDS=60           # Grace period after system/process start before kills (fallback)
KILL_PROCESS_WAIT_TIME=2          # Seconds to wait after SIGTERM before SIGKILL (fallback)

# Emergency Shutdown Settings
# Note: EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN_DELAY moved to thermal.conf for module-specific control
ENABLE_EMERGENCY_SHUTDOWN=true    # Allow emergency shutdown autofix (global fallback)

# Memory Cleanup Settings (moved to memory.conf)
# Note: These settings are now defined in modules/memory/config.conf for better modularity
# - ENABLE_CACHE_DROP: moved to memory.conf
# - ENABLE_EMERGENCY_MEMORY_KILL: moved to memory.conf
# - SWAP_WARNING_THRESHOLD: moved to memory.conf

# Disk Cleanup Settings (moved to disk.conf)
# Note: These settings are now defined in modules/disk/config.conf for better modularity
# - ENABLE_USER_CLEANUP: moved to disk.conf
# - ENABLE_SYSTEM_CLEANUP: moved to disk.conf
# - DISK_CLEANUP_SCRIPT_DIR: moved to disk.conf

# Notification Settings
ENABLE_DESKTOP_NOTIFICATIONS=true   # Show desktop notifications during autofix
ENABLE_WALL_MESSAGES=true          # Send wall messages to all users
ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC_DUMPS=true       # Create diagnostic dumps during emergencies

# Service Management Settings  
ENABLE_SERVICE_RESTART=false       # Allow restarting failed services
SERVICE_RESTART_DELAY=5            # Seconds to wait before restarting services

# Network Settings
ENABLE_NETWORK_RESET=false         # Allow resetting network interfaces
NETWORK_RESET_TIMEOUT=30          # Seconds to wait for network recovery

# Safety Settings
REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=false         # Require user confirmation for dangerous actions
MAX_AUTOFIXES_PER_HOUR=5          # Maximum autofix actions per hour per script
AUTOFIX_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=10       # Minimum time between identical autofix actions

# Logging
AUTOFIX_LOG_LEVEL=info            # Log level for autofix actions (debug/info/warn/error)
