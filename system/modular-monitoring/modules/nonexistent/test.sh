NONEXISTENT MODULE TEST SCRIPT

PURPOSE:
    This is a TEST MODULE that tests for hardware that doesn't exist.
    Used for testing the monitoring framework's error handling.

USAGE:
    ./test.sh                      # Run all tests
    ./test.sh --help               # Show this help information

TEST DESCRIPTION:
    This module tests the following scenarios:
    ‚Ä¢ Quantum flux capacitor hardware detection (should fail)
    ‚Ä¢ Quantum monitoring tools existence (should fail)
    ‚Ä¢ Quantum kernel modules loading (should fail)
    ‚Ä¢ Configuration loading (should pass)
    ‚Ä¢ Temporal anomaly detection (should fail)

NOTE:
    This module is designed for testing purposes only.
    Most tests are expected to fail since the hardware doesn't exist.
