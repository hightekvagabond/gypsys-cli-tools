# Nonexistent Module

## Purpose
This is a test module designed to validate the "hardware existence check" functionality. It always reports that required hardware is missing, which is the expected and correct behavior.

## Features
- Tests hardware detection failure scenarios
- Validates that modules gracefully handle missing hardware
- Demonstrates proper error reporting when hardware doesn't exist

## Hardware Requirements
**None** - This module is designed to always fail hardware detection by looking for "Quantum flux capacitor hardware" which doesn't exist.

## Expected Behavior
- `exists.sh` always exits with code 1 (hardware not found)
- Monitor should skip this module when hardware check fails
- Test scripts should handle this as an "expected failure"

This module serves as a validation tool for the monitoring system's ability to handle missing hardware gracefully.
