## Instructions for AI

### When Completing a Phase:
1. **Commit and tag** the phase completion
2. **Run all tests** to validate functionality
3. **Create VALIDATION document** explaining all changes and decisions
4. **Update this file** with completed phase in "Awaiting Review" section
5. **Reference `.ai-best-practices/BESTJUDGEMENT.md** for decision explanations
6. **Wait for human approval** before proceeding to next phase

### Phase-Based Review Process:
1. **Present each change individually** from VALIDATION document
2. **Explain purpose and reasoning** referencing BESTJUDGEMENT.md entries
3. **Apply human feedback** in separate post-review cleanup phase
4. **Repeat review cycle** until developer satisfied

## Instructions for Humans

1. **Review completed phases**: Check code, functionality, and AI decisions  
2. **Review `.ai-best-practices/BESTJUDGEMENT.md****: Validate autonomous decisions
3. **Move approved phases**: From "Awaiting Review" to "Archive" section
4. **Add future phases**: Define new phases in "Future Phases" section for AI to tackle
5. **Request cleanup**: Add post-review cleanup phases when needed
