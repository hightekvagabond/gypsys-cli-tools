# Gypsy's CLI Tools

A handful of scripts I've written that I find useful working on Ubuntu. Your mileage may vary on other operating systems, but they are free to use.

This is an ongoing collection of quick scripts that I've needed at various points - I keep them here so I don't have to rewrite the same utilities over and over.

## Tools

Each directory contains a specific tool with its own README explaining what it does and how to use it:

- **aws/** - AWS-related utilities
- **bitwarden/** - Bitwarden CLI helpers  
- **check-repos/** - Repository management and health checks
- **git-private2public/** - Convert private repos to public with clean history
- **random/** - Miscellaneous one-off scripts
- **system/** - System administration and configuration tools

## Usage

Most tools are standalone scripts. Check the individual README files in each directory for specific usage instructions.
